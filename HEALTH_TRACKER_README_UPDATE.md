# Health Tracker Project - Implementation Update

## 🚀 Recent Updates

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ Generated Hive adapters for all models:
  - UserModel
  - GoalModel
  - MealPlanModel
- ✅ Registered new model adapters with Hive
- ✅ Created repository interfaces for:
  - UserRepository
  - GoalRepository
  - MealPlanRepository

### Implementation Progress
- The model layer for the core entities (User, Goal, MealPlan) is now complete
- Repository interfaces have been defined to standardize data access
- ✅ Implemented GoalRepositoryImpl with Hive storage
- ✅ Created GoalProvider for state management
- ✅ Implemented goal management UI:
  - Modern goal creation screen following Apple's HIG
  - Goal list screen with active/completed goals
  - Goal progress tracking and updates
  - Goal deletion functionality

## 🛠️ Next Steps

1. **Complete UI Implementation**
   - Implement meal planning interface
   - Add recipe search and details screens
   - Create nutritional analysis dashboard
   - Add recipe recommendations

2. **Enhance Goal Features**
   - Add goal analytics and insights
   - Implement goal-based recipe recommendations
   - Add progress visualization charts
   - Create goal sharing functionality

3. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Write unit tests for repositories
   - Test UI flows
   - Optimize performance

## 🔨 How to Generate Adapters

If you make changes to any of the model classes, you'll need to regenerate the Hive adapters:

```bash
# Use the provided script
./scripts/generate_code.sh

# Or run the command directly
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## 📝 Implementation Details

### Model Structure
- **User**: Stores user profile information, preferences, and allergies
- **Goal**: Represents health and fitness goals with target values and progress tracking
- **MealPlan**: Manages meal planning with recipes for different meal types

### Data Flow
1. UI interacts with Providers
2. Providers use Repositories for data operations
3. Repositories handle data storage and retrieval with Hive
4. Hive adapters serialize/deserialize models for storage
